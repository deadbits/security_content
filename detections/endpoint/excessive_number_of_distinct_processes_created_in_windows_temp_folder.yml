description: This analytic will identify suspicious series of process executions.  We have observed that post exploit
  framework tools like Koadic and Meterpreter will launch an excessive number of processes with distinct file paths from
  Windows\Temp to execute actions on objective.  This behavior is extremely anomalous compared to typical application
  behaviors that use Windows\Temp.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed sc.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: Many benign applications will create processes from executables in Windows\Temp,
  although unlikely to exceed the given threshold.  Filter as needed.
