description: This analytic detects a potential suspicious modification of firewall
  rule registry allowing inbound traffic in specific port with public profile. This
  technique was seen in some attacker want to have a remote access to a machine by
  allowing the traffic in firewall rule.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\FirewallRules\\*"
  Registry.registry_value_name = "*|Action=Allow|*" Registry.registry_value_name =
  "*|Dir=In|*" Registry.registry_value_name = "*|Profile=Public|*" Registry.registry_value_name

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: network admin may add/remove/modify public inbound firewall
  rule that may cause this rule to be triggered.
