description: This search is to detect a modification to registry to enable rdp to
  a machine with different port number. This technique was seen in some atttacker
  tries to do lateral movement and remote access to a compromised machine to gain
  control of it.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Registry.registry_key_name)
  as registry_key_name values(Registry.registry_path) as registry_path min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path="*HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal
  Server\\WinStations\\RDP-Tcp*" Registry.registry_key_name = "PortNumber" by Registry.dest
  Registry.user Registry.registry_value_name | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `enable_rdp_in_other_port_number_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
